4th and Final project for IS218 at NJIT.

Project 4 - For project 4 you must use the following repository to create a program that allows a user to register,
login, and upload the CSV file included with the project repository.   The user dashboard must display a table of transactions
and it must display the current balance of the account based on the transactions.  The starting balance of the account is 0 and
is determined by adding and subtracting debits and credits to the account that are identified as such in the CSV file.
